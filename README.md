# orderedEnchanting-Demo
get the best order for enchanting. 
This is a demo using Python3.

Hopefully someone could transform this to be a Minecraft mod.

It generates optimal enchanting order in most cases, and nearly optimal enchanting order in the rest.

Example:

(Optimal, in https://github.com/hqqaazz/orderedEnchanting-Demo/wiki/Optimal-enchantment-order)

1:Sweeping Edge III
2:Looting III+Sharpness V/Smite V/Bane of Arthropods V
3:(Fire Aspect II+Unbreaking III) + (Knockback II+Mending)

(3 Prior Work Penalty，Highest exp level:17，Total exp level:52)
*Total exp require(not exp level):883

(nearly optimal, by the program)
1:Sweeping Edge III
2:Looting III+Fire Aspect II
3:(Sharpness V/Smite V/Bane of Arthropods V+Unbreaking III) + (Knockback II+Mending)

(3 Prior Work Penalty，Highest exp level:18，Total exp level:51)
*Total exp require(not exp level):884
